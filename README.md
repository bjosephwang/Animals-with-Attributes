Project for Data mining lecture

Dataset and classification method from

[1] C. H. Lampert, H. Nickisch, and S. Harmeling. "Learning To Detect Unseen Object Classes by Between-Class Attribute Transfer". In CVPR, 2009 (pdf)

The class/attribute matrix was originally created by:

[2] D. N. Osherson, J. Stern, O. Wilkie, M. Stob, and E. E. Smith. "Default probability". Cognitive Science, 15(2), 1991.

To reproduce experminets data in `code/feat` is necessary. If you have original Animals with Attributes data, you only need to run `create_data.py` script from there. In `code/results` directory trained classifiers are saved.
